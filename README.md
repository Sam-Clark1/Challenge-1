### HTML Changes

Accessibility

- Updated header to include more meta tags and gave website a proper title.
- Added link to website title to take you back to main page and also fixed broken "search engine optimization" link. 
- Added alt attributes to each image.

Semantics and Organization

- Changed many of the div containers to descriptive ones that match their content (ex. header, section, etc.).
- Combined classes in the content section instead of having multiple unnecessary classes. Did the same in the benefits section. 

### CSS Changes

- Organized css elements into a more acceptable order. 
- Changed colors on main title to have the "seo" in Horiseon be more pronounced. 
- Added comments stating where css for each part of the website begins and ends. 
- Combined classes where multiple classes were doing the same thing.
- Fixed margins on benefits section to be the same length as content section. 
- Made all the blue the same type.
