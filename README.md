### HTML Changes

    Accessibility

    - Updated header to include more meta tags and gave website a proper title.
    - Added link to website title to take you back to main page and also fixed broken "search engine optimization" link. 

    Semantics and Organization

    - Changed many of the div containers to descriptive ones that match their content (ex. header, section, etc.).
    - Combined classes in the content section instead of having multiple unnecessary classes. Did the same in the benefits section. 

### CSS Changes

    - Organized css elements into a more acceptable order. 
    - Changed colors on main title to have the "seo" in Horiseon be more pronounced. 
    - Added comments stating where css for each part of the website begins and ends. 
    - Combined classes where multiple classes were doing the same thing.
    - Fixed margins on benefits section to be the same length as content section. 
    - Made all the blue the same type.
